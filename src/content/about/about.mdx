title: Who am I?
---

I'm a fourth-year CS + Physics student at McGill who chases impactâ€”I'm interested in creating tools
that directly help others, or enable them to make a difference in turn. In my past internships at 
Autodesk and the Canadian Space Agency, I was fortunate to work on projects that expedited the 
web development process for colleagues. 

Lately, I've been doing research in machine learning and am excited to continue to apply it to real-world problems.

My ultimate goal is to learn and expand my technical skills as much as I can, to make a positive difference wherever I go.

In my spare time I enjoy hiking and camping, building Lego, and exploring my surroundings with my camera.
