title: Who am I?
---

I'm a fourth-year CS + Physics student at McGill who chases impactâ€”I'm interested in creating tools
that directly help others, or enable them to make a difference in turn. 

Lately, I've been doing research 
with machine learning and am excited to continue to apply it to real-world problems. I'm also experienced 
and interested in full-stack development.

With a customer service background, curiosity, and the drive to help others, 
my goal is to expand my knowledge to make a positive impact wherever I go.

In my spare time I enjoy hiking and camping, building Lego, and exploring my surroundings with my camera.
