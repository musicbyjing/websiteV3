import Underlining from "../../styles/Underlining"

I'm a 4th-year CS + Physics student at McGill who chases <Underlining color="secondary" hoverColor="secondary">**impact**</Underlining>â€”
I'm interested in creating tools that directly help others, or enable them to make a difference in turn.

Lately, I've been doing research with <Underlining color="secondary" hoverColor="secondary">**machine learning**</Underlining>
and am excited to continue to apply it to real-world problems,
 such as in <Underlining color="secondary" hoverColor="secondary">**data science**</Underlining> contexts.


I'm also experienced and interested in <Underlining color="secondary" hoverColor="secondary">**full-stack development**</Underlining>.

With a customer service background, curiosity, and the drive to help others, 
my goal is to expand my knowledge to make a positive impact wherever I go.

In my spare time I enjoy hiking and camping, building Lego, and exploring my surroundings with my camera.
