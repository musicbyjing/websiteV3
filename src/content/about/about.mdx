import Underlining from "../../styles/Underlining"

I'm a McGill CS + Physics grad.

Lately, I've been doing research using <Underlining color="secondary" hoverColor="secondary">**machine learning**</Underlining>
and am excited to continue to apply it to real-world problems. I'm also experienced in <Underlining color="secondary" hoverColor="secondary">**full-stack development**</Underlining>,
honed through stints at the Canadian Space Agency and Autodesk, where I developed internal tools to expedite developer workflows.

In my spare time I enjoy hiking and camping, building Lego, and exploring my surroundings with my camera.

With a customer service background, curiosity, and the drive to help others, 
my goal is to expand my knowledge to make a <Underlining color="secondary" hoverColor="secondary">**positive impact**</Underlining> wherever I go.
